As a difference versus the FpML standard, the CDM structure of this class only includes the productIdentifier class, which consists of an identifier, productTaxonomy, and source of the identifier. The reason for this approach is to avoid the potential for conflicting information between the information associated with the contractual product and the reference information maintained by the relevant service provider.",
