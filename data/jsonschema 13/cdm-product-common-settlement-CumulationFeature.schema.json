  "description": "Describe provisions which define how the quantity is incremented over time. When cumulationDates only is defined, the cumulation for such particular period is 'guarenteed'. In case the cumulation would be 'contigent', Knock-In conditions may be defined. Besides, a 'lever' may also be defined i.e. multiplier value to apply on the quantity incremented. Main business case is to define 'Accumulator' or 'Decumulator' products, which final payoff calculation eventually consists in applying the payout formula to an aggregated quantity, that being a sum of multiple quantity increment periods - hence the multiple cardinality of this attribute. For intance, say A + B + C + ... + N-1 are distinct cumulation conditions in termsheet, then such payoff would be represented by defining N distinct CumulationFeature in array e.g. CumulationFeature[A], CumulationFeature[B], CumulationFeature[C], [...], CumulationFeature[N-1], each with any appropriate 'guaranteed' or 'contigent' and/or 'levered' features, as need be.",
